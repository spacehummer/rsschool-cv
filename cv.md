## About Me
I love everything related to electronics, engineering and development. Initially, I saw myself as a civill engineer, but in the course of my life I realized that programming and software development attract me more.
I had an interesting experience working on communication equipment and some website development.
Now I am focused on software development because I am sure that various software products are important for improving the life of mankind. They improve it no less than construction and other modern technologies and are often intertwined with other technologies.
